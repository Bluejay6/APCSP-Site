			<p> Outside of school, I am a member of the Resilient Strength Gym, where I lift 2 times a week, and I am a member of BSA, a life scout that is soon to be eagle. I have recently completed my eagle project, and will soon become an eagle scout. I have been in scouts for 7 years at this point. </p>
